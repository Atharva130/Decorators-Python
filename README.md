# Decorators in Python

## Introduction
Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow modification of the behavior of functions or classes without changing their actual code. They are often used for logging, access control, timing, and more.

## Key Concepts
- Functions that take another function as input and return a new function  
- Use the `@decorator_name` syntax  
- Support for nested functions and closures  
- Can be applied to functions and methods  

## Topics to Learn
- Creating custom decorators  
- Using built-in decorators like `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property`  
- Applying multiple decorators  
- Understanding closures and higher-order functions
